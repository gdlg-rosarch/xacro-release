ros-jade-xacro (1.10.0-0vivid) vivid; urgency=high

  * security measure: forbid access to __builtins__ in expressions
  * fixed evaluation issue #49:
    - literal evaluation should only consider literals, but no expressionsuse ast.literal_eval()
    
      * removed eval() from xacro:if evaluation
    
  * back to string comparison to handle (lowercase) true and false
  * added test cases to check
    - for equality expressions in <xacro:if>
    - math function usage
  * python based evaluation of expressions
    - replaced handle_expr with python-internal eval() call
    - care has been taken to resolve variables recursively on demand(in Table.__getitem__)
    
      * allows for evaluation of standard math functions
      * other desired functions could be added in eval_self_contained
      * Values in Table symbols are not stored as strings but as typed values.
    
  * If text is required, a conversion with str() is performed, to ensure
    proper evaluation of expressions. Otherwise 3*"1" would evaluate to "111".
  * use __future__.division we can handle integer division evaluating to
    floating-point devision, as before
  * allow variable names for filename attribute in <xacro:include>
  * allow for ordered XML processing to avoid issues with multiply defined
    properties and macros in (typically 3rd party) include files
    - enable the new behaviour by passing --inorder cmdline option
    - to improve code readibility and reusability, introduced functions
  * process_include(node), grab_macro(elt, macros), grab_property(elt, symbols)
    containing 1:1 corresponding handling from process_includes, grab_macros,
    and grab_properties
    - added corresponding test case test_inorder_processing()
  * dynamic macro names using <xacro:call macro=""/>
  * fixup unittests and handling of non-element nodes in <include>, <if>, <macro>
  * updated pr2 gold standard to include all comments
  * allow to ignore comments in nodes_match()
  * New handling of non-element nodes invalidates pr2 gold standard (adding
    a lot more comments). To allow validation, allow to ignore all
    comments in comparison (as before).
  * fixed handling of non-element nodes in <include>, <if>, <macro>
  * fixed writexml: text nodes were not printed when other siblings exist
    - print all text, but skip whitespace-only text nodes
  * improved xml matching
    - so far only element nodes (with its attributes) were considered
    - now also consider TEXT, CDATA, and COMMENT nodes
    - added function text_matches (normalizing consecutive whitespaceto a single space)added some new unit tests
    - test_consider_non_elements:
    non-element nodes are not yet considered in <if> and <macro>
  * travis-ci: use catkin_make
  * travis-ci: fixup running of tests
  * fix pathnames used in test case
  * Include CATKIN_ENV params at build time.
  * use output filename flag instead of shell redirection
  * create output file after parsing is complete, not before
